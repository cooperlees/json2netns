# json2netns

JSON parsing Linux Network Namespace (netns) topology builder.

- What is a Linux Namespace - aka NetNS?

# Install

```console
pip install git+git://github.com/cooperlees/json2netns
```

# Concepts + Usage

The script takes a JSON config file and drives namespace creation from that JSON toplogy file.
Lets look at the following simple two network namespace topology:

![json2netns sample topology](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3005596/117493918-79af0d00-af28-11eb-96df-ba2f43d889f2.png)

We have two namespaces that have 1 direct connection via a veth. It also has a OOB (Out of Band)
set of interfaces that allow the main Linux Network Namespace to communicate with the netns directly.

- By default it even bridges with a physical interface to allow external packets to be routed into the netns if desired.

## Configuration

The above topology is represented by [sample.json](https://github.com/cooperlees/json2netns/blob/main/src/json2netns/sample.json). This config is also used by unittests to ensure correct functioning. We can add to it over time as we add more features.

### Small Black 1 NS Example JSON Config

```json
{
    "namespaces": {
        "left": {
            "id": 1,
            "interfaces": {
                "left0": {
                    "prefixes": ["fd00::1/64", "10.1.1.1/24"],
                    "peer_name": "right0",
                    "type": "veth"
                },
                "lo": {
                    "prefixes": ["fd00:1::/64", "10.6.9.1/32"],
                    "type": "loopback"
                }
            },
            "oob": false,
            "routes": {}
        }
    },
    "oob": {},
    "physical_int": ""
}
```

# Development

## Install

```console
python3 -m venv [--upgrade-deps] /tmp/tj
/tmp/tj/bin/pip install -r requirements_test.txt wheel
/tmp/tj/bin/pip install -e .
````

## Run Tests

```console
/tmp/tj/bin/ptr [-k] [--print-cov] [--debug]
```

- `-k`: keep venv ptr creates
- `--print-cov`: handy to see what coverage is on all files
- `--debug`: Handy to see all commands run so you can run a step manually
